The resultsSolar.csv and resultsWind.csv files have been generated with the open source simulator SAM developped by NREL (U.S.A) : https://sam.nrel.gov/
 
Both of the files contains data of two different microgrids:
** the first one (resultsSolar.csv) contains generation and consumption (among others) data of a microgrid connected to the main grid and feed by a solar generator
** the second one (resultsWind.csv) contains generation and consumption (among others) data of a microgrid connected to the main grid and feed by a wind based generator

Both of the files have the same number of columns, the data columns we are interested on are: 

"System power generated | (kW)" Power generated by the solar or wind generator
"Electricity load (year 1) | (kW)" Energy consummed by the consummer.
